## Service Journal
This is a prototype mobile app I designed to allow users to keep track of what services they accomplished for each of their clients when they accomplished them, and their status.

## Motivation
I decided to make this app because I wanted to assist my father's company and update his method of keeping track of what services he provided throughout a given month and to which clients.
